Installing firmware
-------------------

Preparing Blue Pill
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Make sure that you have the right resistor installed on R10, since some computers will not work with the wrongly installed resistors. If you have a wrong one you can still try it, since it works most of the time. More information: https://www.onetransistor.eu/2017/11/stm32-bluepill-arduino-ide.html

2. Follow this tutorial to install the bootloader on the blue pill https://medium.com/@paramaggarwal/programming-an-stm32f103-board-using-usb-port-blue-pill-953cec0dbc86
   BUT add the "-e" option when running the python script to erase the memory or it may not work

3. If you want to use Arduino you can see here how you can use it
https://www.onetransistor.eu/2017/11/stm32-bluepill-arduino-ide.html

4. install also https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32 and https://github.com/Molorius/ADS126X

5. make sure you have the correct rights or directly use sudo


Writing Firmware on Blue Pill
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Open main sketch in arduino

2. Flash onto Blue Pill (you may have to press the reset button)




Use ADS Library available at https://github.com/Molorius/ADS126X
